Scalding is a Scala library that makes it easy to specify Hadoop MapReduce
jobs. Scalding is built on top of Cascading, a Java library that abstracts
away low-level Hadoop details. Scalding is comparable to Pig, but offers tight
integration with Scala, bringing advantages of Scala to your MapReduce jobs.
